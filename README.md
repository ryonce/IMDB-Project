# IMDB Project
 
## Process

- First steps were to make an API call to IMDB and then save the data to personal Jupyter Notebook

- After cleaning and filtering data to conditions given, I ran a function that would loop through the entire data to pull information into a JSON file.

- I then took the JSON files to create a SQL database from Juptyer Notebook.

- In the end, we took the condensed files to perform hypothesis tests to accept or reject the null hypothesis.

## Takeaways

- There is much data out there but having the ability to filter and put into a format that can be used for anaylsis is important.

- Having a database that you can form yourself to help you dissect the data is important and forming your own SQL database.

- Hypothesis testing is quite the process but can help you prove to accept or reject that might be hard to see just with eyes.
