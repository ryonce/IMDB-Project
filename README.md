# IMDB Project
 
## Process

- First steps were to make an API call to IMDB and then save the data to personal Jupyter Notebook

- After cleaning and filtering data to conditions given, I ran a function that would loop through the entire data to pull information into a JSON file.

- I then took the JSON files to create a SQL database from Juptyer Notebook.

- In the end, we took the condensed files to perform hypothesis tests to accept or reject the null hypothesis.
